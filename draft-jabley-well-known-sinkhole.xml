    <abstract>
      <t>A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to
	direct that traffic at nominated addresses within a network
	that are null-routed; that is, packets with such destination
	addresses are discarded silently by routers with a null
	route for that destination configured. These addresses are
	colloquially known as black holes, by analogy with the same
	term used in astrophysics to describe a void in spacetime
	where gravity prohibits anything from escaping once having
	crossed the event horizon. Alternatively, traffic may be
	redirected to quarantine, to isolate, contain and limit any
	potentially harmful effects. Quarantine addresses may permit
	some bidirectional communications whereas a black hole may
	receive, but never originate traffic.</t>

      <t>This document describes an Internet-scope anycast black hole
	and quarantine service with associated well-known, permanent
	IPv4 and IPv6 address assignments, and provides guidance
	both for network operators and for those wishing to use the
	service to discard unwanted traffic efficiently.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes a set of addresses that are provided
	for use in redirecting unwanted traffic.  The use of
	designated address ranges for unwanted traffic helps maximize
	Internet robustness and limits confusion arising from
	uncoordinated efforts.</t>

      <t>Network operators have developed a variety of techniques
	to mitigate unwanted traffic, but one common approach is
	to redirect traffic to a a destination using the routing
	system.  When traffic to a particular destination or set
	of destinations is unwanted, the routing system can be used
	to divert the traffic to black hole or, alternatively, a
	quarantine network.  A black hole effectively discards
	traffic immediately by forwarding traffic to unwanted
	destinations to a null route, such as is described in <xref
	target="RFC3882"/>.  While a black hole will accept traffic
	to the redirected destinations, a black hole will never
	respond to redirected traffic.  In other words, traffic may
	enter a black hole, but traffic may never originate from
	the black hole.  A quarantine network may respond to the
	unwanted traffic that has been redirected and it may even
	originate traffic, but a quarantine network is designed to
	contain and limit the effects of any traffic towards the
	redirected destinations.  The Conficker Working Group (CWG)
	mitigated a network threat using this approach.  TODO: CWG
	reference.</t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
	"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
	and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
	described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Existing Facilities">
      <t>Network-scope sinkholes are in widespread use as destinations
	for remote-triggered black holes <xref target="RFC3882"/>,
	<xref target="RFC5635"/>. The addresses of the sinkholes
	used for these purposes are generally specific to the network
	operator that deployed them, and their details not widely
        published.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6666"/> describes IPv6 addresses assigned
	for the purpose of discarding traffic. Those addresses are
	not intended to be used across autonomous-system borders,
	however; they are not observed to be generally "reachable"
	and are frequently the subject of martian filtering <xref
	target="RFC2827"/>.</t>
