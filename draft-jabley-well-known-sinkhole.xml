    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to
        direct that traffic at nominated addresses within a network
        that are null-routed; that is, packets with such destination
        addresses are discarded silently by routers with a null
        route for that destination configured. These addresses are
        colloquially known as sinkholes, by analogy with the same
        term used in Physical Geography to describe a hole in the
        ground formed by some form of collapse of the surface
        layer, into which objects may fall and be lost forever.</t>

      <t>It is common practice for network operators to configure 
        such sinkholes on many or all of their routers in order to
        avoid the cost of transporting packets across a backbone
        only for them to be discarded. This configuration is, in
        effect, a network-scope, anycast sinkhole service. The
        addresses used for such sinkhole services are typically
        assigned from address pools administered by the network
        operator, and are for internal use.</t>

      <t>This document describes an Internet-scope anycast sinkhole
        service with associated well-known, permanent IPv4 and IPv6
        address assignments, and provides guidance both for network
        operators and for those wishing to use the service to discard
        unwanted traffic efficiently.</t>

    <section title="Existing Facilities">
      <t>Network-scope sinkholes are in widespread use as destinations
	for remote-triggered black holes <xref target="RFC3882"/>,
	<xref target="RFC5635"/>. The addresses of the sinkholes
	used for these purposes are generally specific to the network
	operator that deployed them, and are not published.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6666"/> describes IPv6 addresses assigned
	for the purpose of discarding traffic. Those addresses are
	not intended to be used across autonomous-system borders,
	however; they are not observed to be generally "reachable"
	and are frequently the subject of martian filtering <xref
	target="RFC2827"/>.</t>

              Suitable delegations for those zones should be provisioned
              from their parents.</t>
