                 A Well-Known Sinkhole for the Internet
                  draft-jabley-well-known-sinkhole-00

Abstract

   A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to direct that
   traffic at nominated addresses within a network that are null-routed;
   that is, packets with such destination addresses are discarded
   silently by routers with a null route for that destination
   configured.  These addresses are colloquially known as black holes,
   by analogy with the same term used in astrophysics to describe a void
   in spacetime where gravity prohibits anything from escaping once
   having crossed the event horizon.  Alternatively, traffic may be
   redirected to quarantine, to isolate, contain and limit any
   potentially harmful effects.  Quarantine addresses may permit some
   bidirectional communications whereas a black hole may receive, but
   never originate traffic.

   This document describes an Internet-scope anycast black hole and
   quarantine service with associated well-known, permanent IPv4 and
   IPv6 address assignments, and provides guidance both for network
   operators and for those wishing to use the service to discard
   unwanted traffic efficiently.

Internet-Draft   A Well-Known Sinkhole for the Internet    February 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a set of addresses that are provided for use
   in redirecting unwanted traffic.  The use of designated address
   ranges for unwanted traffic helps maximize Internet robustness and
   limits confusion arising from uncoordinated efforts.

   Network operators have developed a variety of techniques to mitigate
   unwanted traffic, but one common approach is to redirect traffic to a
   a destination using the routing system.  When traffic to a particular
   destination or set of destinations is unwanted, the routing system
   can be used to divert the traffic to black hole or, alternatively, a
   quarantine network.  A black hole effectively discards traffic
   immediately by forwarding traffic to unwanted destinations to a null
   route, such as is described in [RFC3882].  While a black hole will
   accept traffic to the redirected destinations, a black hole will
   never respond to redirected traffic.  In other words, traffic may
   enter a black hole, but traffic may never originate from the black
   hole.  A quarantine network may respond to the unwanted traffic that
   has been redirected and it may even originate traffic, but a
   quarantine network is designed to contain and limit the effects of
   any traffic towards the redirected destinations.  The Conficker
   Working Group (CWG) mitigated a network threat using this approach.
