                A Well-Known Black Hole for the Internet
                  draft-jabley-well-known-blackhole-00

Abstract

   A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to direct that
   traffic at nominated addresses within a network that are null-routed;
   that is, packets with such destination addresses are discarded
   silently by routers with a null route for that destination
   configured.  These addresses are colloquially known as black holes,
   by analogy with the same term used in astrophysics to describe a void
   in spacetime where gravity prohibits anything from escaping once
   having crossed the event horizon.  Alternatively, traffic may be
   redirected to quarantine, to isolate, contain and limit any
   potentially harmful effects.  Quarantine addresses may permit some
   bidirectional communications whereas a black hole may receive, but
   never originate traffic.

   This document describes an Internet-scope anycast black hole and
   quarantine service with associated well-known, permanent IPv4 and
   IPv6 address assignments, and provides guidance both for network
   operators and for those wishing to use the service to discard
   unwanted traffic efficiently.

Internet-Draft  A Well-Known Black Hole for the Internet   February 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a set of addresses that are provided for use
   in redirecting unwanted traffic.  The use of designated address
   ranges for unwanted traffic helps maximize Internet robustness and
   limits confusion arising from uncoordinated efforts.

   Network operators have developed a variety of techniques to mitigate
   unwanted traffic, but one common approach is to redirect traffic to a
   a destination using the routing system.  When traffic to a particular
   destination or set of destinations is unwanted, the routing system
   can be used to divert the traffic to black hole or, alternatively, a
   quarantine network.  A black hole effectively discards traffic
   immediately by forwarding traffic to unwanted destinations to a null
   route, such as is described in [RFC3882].  While a black hole will
   accept traffic to the redirected destinations, a black hole will
   never respond to redirected traffic.  In other words, traffic may
   enter a black hole, but traffic may never originate from the black
   hole.  A quarantine network may respond to the unwanted traffic that
   has been redirected and it may even originate traffic, but a
   quarantine network is designed to contain and limit the effects of
   any traffic towards the redirected destinations.  The Conficker
   Working Group (CWG) mitigated a network threat using this approach.

3.  Existing Facilities

   Network-scope sinkholes are in widespread use as destinations for
   remote-triggered black holes [RFC3882], [RFC5635].  The addresses of
   the sinkholes used for these purposes are generally specific to the
   network operator that deployed them, and their details not widely
   published.

   [RFC6666] describes IPv6 addresses assigned for the purpose of
   discarding traffic.  Those addresses are not intended to be used
   across autonomous-system borders, however; they are not observed to
   be generally "reachable" and are frequently the subject of martian
   filtering [RFC2827].

   resources in conformance with section 4 of [RFC2860].

   The IANA is requested to assign one IPv4 /24 netblock and register
   its use in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry [RFC6890] as

             +----------------------+-----------------------+

8.2.  DNS Provisioning

   The IANA is further requested to arrange reverse DNS for all
   individual addresses assigned in Section 8.1.  All addresses should
   map to the name SINKHOLE.ARPA.  The name SINKHOLE.ARPA should map to
   the lowest addresses assigned for each address family.

   The following approach is suggested.  The IANA is free to choose
   other approaches.

   1.  The zone SINKHOLE.ARPA should be provisioned on suitable
       nameservers as described in Figure 1.  A delegation for
       SINKHOLE.ARPA to those nameservers from the ARPA zone should be
       provisioned.

   2.  The reverse zone or zones for the assigned IPv4 and IPv6
       addresses should be provisioned on suitable nameservers as
       described in Figure 2.  Suitable delegations for those zones
       should be provisioned from their parents.

   3.  All zones should be signed with DNSSEC parameters of the IANA's
       choosing, and all delegations should be secure.
