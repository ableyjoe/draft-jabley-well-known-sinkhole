                 A Well-Known Sinkhole for the Internet
                  draft-jabley-well-known-sinkhole-00

Abstract

   A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to direct that
   traffic at nominated addresses within a network that are null-routed;
   that is, packets with such destination addresses are discarded
   silently by routers with a null route for that destination
   configured.  These addresses are colloquially known as sinkholes, by
   analogy with the same term used in Physical Geography to describe a
   hole in the ground formed by some form of collapse of the surface
   layer, into which objects may fall and be lost forever.

   This document describes an Internet-scope anycast sinkhole service
   with associated well-known, permanent IPv4 and IPv6 address
   assignments, and provides guidance both for network operators and for
   those wishing to use the service to discard unwanted traffic
   efficiently.

1.  Introduction

   A common method for dealing with unwanted traffic is to direct that
   traffic at nominated addresses within a network that are null-routed;
   that is, packets with such destination addresses are discarded
   silently by routers with a null route for that destination
   configured.  These addresses are colloquially known as sinkholes, by
   analogy with the same term used in Physical Geography to describe a
   hole in the ground formed by some form of collapse of the surface
   layer, into which objects may fall and be lost forever.

   It is common practice for network operators to configure such
   sinkholes on many or all of their routers in order to avoid the cost
   of transporting packets across a backbone only for them to be
   discarded.  This configuration is, in effect, a network-scope,
   anycast sinkhole service.  The addresses used for such sinkhole

   services are typically assigned from address pools administered by
   the network operator, and are for internal use.

   This document describes an Internet-scope anycast sinkhole service
   with associated well-known, permanent IPv4 and IPv6 address
   assignments, and provides guidance both for network operators and for
   those wishing to use the service to discard unwanted traffic
   efficiently.

2.  Existing Facilities

   Network-scope sinkholes are in widespread use as destinations for
   remote-triggered black holes [RFC3882], [RFC5635].  The addresses of
   the sinkholes used for these purposes are generally specific to the
   network operator that deployed them, and their details not widely
   published.

   [RFC6666] describes IPv6 addresses assigned for the purpose of
   discarding traffic.  Those addresses are not intended to be used
   across autonomous-system borders, however; they are not observed to
   be generally "reachable" and are frequently the subject of martian
   filtering [RFC2827].

   XX provide guidance!  XX

6.  IAB Considerations

   The IAB is requested to approve the delegation of the SINKHOLE.ARPA
   zone described in Section 7 in accordance with [RFC3172].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Address Assignment

   This document requests that IANA assign IPv4 and IPv6 number
   resources in conformance with section 4 of [RFC2860].

   The IANA is requested to assign one IPv4 /24 netblock and register
   its use in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry [RFC6890] as
   follows:

             +----------------------+-----------------------+

             |                      |                       |
             | Allocation Date      | As determined by IANA |

             | Forwardable          | True                  |
             |                      |                       |
             | Global               | True                  |
             |                      |                       |
             | Reserved-by-Protocol | False                 |
             +----------------------+-----------------------+

   The IANA is requested to assign one IPv6 /48 netblock and register
   its use in the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry [RFC6890] as
   follows:

7.2.  DNS Provisioning

   The IANA is further requested to arrange reverse DNS for all
   individual addresses assigned in Section 7.1.  All addresses should
   map to the name SINKHOLE.ARPA.  The name SINKHOLE.ARPA should map to
   the lowest addresses assigned for each address family.

   The following approach is suggested.  The IANA is free to choose
   other approaches.

   1.  The zone SINKHOLE.ARPA should be provisioned on suitable
       nameservers as described in Figure 1.  A delegation for
       SINKHOLE.ARPA to those nameservers from the ARPA zone should be
       provisioned.

   2.  The reverse zone or zones for the assigned IPv4 and IPv6
       addresses should be provisioned on suitable nameservers as
       described in Figure 2.  Suitable delegations for those zones
       should be provisioned from their parents.

   3.  All zones should be signed with DNSSEC parameters of the IANA's
       choosing, and all delegations should be secure.
